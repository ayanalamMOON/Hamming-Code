# Directory Organization Summary

## Completed Reorganization

The repository has been successfully reorganized with the following structure:

### New Directory Structure

```
Hamming-Code/
├── src/                    # Source code files
├── include/ecc/           # Header files
├── test/                  # Test source files
├── examples/              # Example and demo files
├── output/                # Compiled executables and object files
├── benchmarks/            # Benchmark source files
├── build/                 # Build artifacts (CMake objects)
├── build-cmake/           # CMake build directory
├── bin/                   # Additional binaries
└── (root files)           # Configuration and documentation files
```

### Files Moved

#### Test Files → `test/`
- All `test_*.cpp` files moved to `test/` directory
- Test executables moved to `output/` directory

#### Examples/Demos → `examples/`
- `bch_demo.cpp`
- `error_simulation_example.cpp`
- `ber_analysis_test.cpp`
- Demo executables moved to `output/` directory

#### Output Files → `output/`
- All `.exe` files (executables)
- All `.o` files (object files)
- All compiled binaries

#### Build Scripts Updated
- `Makefile` updated with new directory variables and paths
- `CMakeLists.txt` updated with new source and test directories

### Build System Configuration

The build system has been updated to reflect the new directory structure:

#### Makefile Variables:
```makefile
SRC_DIR = src
INCLUDE_DIR = include
TEST_DIR = test
EXAMPLES_DIR = examples
OUTPUT_DIR = output
BUILD_DIR = build
```

#### CMakeLists.txt Updates:
- Source files now referenced from `src/` directory
- Include directories properly configured
- Test executables configured to build in appropriate locations

## Current Status

✅ Directory structure organized
✅ Files moved to appropriate directories
✅ Build scripts updated
❌ Build currently failing due to existing compilation errors (not related to reorganization)

## Next Steps

The directory reorganization is complete. The current build failures are due to existing compilation errors in the code (specifically issues with `std::bitset` iteration in performance analyzer) that were present before the reorganization and need to be fixed separately.

To build successfully, the compilation errors in the performance analyzer code need to be resolved.
